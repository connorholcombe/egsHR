                <li>If your account has e-mail functionality enabled, you may also check the applicable email options to send an automated email to each employee notifying them that their evaluation is active.</li>

              This option should only be utilized once the self and supervisor evaluation periods have ended. Closing an evaluation will finalize and submit the information input in the self and supervisor evaluations. Closing an evaluation means that this employee will no longer show up in the "Submission Status" statistics, but will now have their scores included in the "Score Summary" statistics, as well as the "Succession" pages.

              Reopening an evaluation will only be done if an employee or supervisor need to have access to a previosly closed evaluation. If the employee or supervisor is simply ready to complete their evaluation in the next review period, you will follow the steps in the "launch evaluations" section.

                <li>Select the "edit" button on the right side of the employee's row whose evaluation needs to be reopened.</li>
                <li>Check the "reopen evaluation" option. You can also activate either the self-evaluation or the supervisor-evaluation at this time. If both are left inactive, the employee and supervisor will not be able to access the evaluation.</li>
                <li>Select the "update" button to apply these changes. Be sure not to apply this process to the same employee multiple times in a row, as that would overwrite the evaluation data with what was submitted in the previous evaluation period.</li>
